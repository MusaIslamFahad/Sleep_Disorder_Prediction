# ðŸ’¤ Sleep Disorder Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict sleep disorders based on personal, health, and lifestyle data. The dataset includes various features such as age, gender, occupation, sleep duration, stress level, and medical history. The goal is to develop an accurate model that can assist in identifying individuals at risk for sleep disorders.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations to understand feature relationships and class distribution.
- **Model Training & Evaluation:** Implementation of classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM.
- **Performance Metrics:** Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix used for evaluation.
- **User-Friendly Jupyter Notebook:** Well-commented and structured for readability and educational purposes.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- Python  
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains anonymized health and behavioral data that may influence sleep patterns and disorders. It includes:

- Demographics (Age, Gender, BMI)
- Sleep information (Duration, Quality)
- Psychological and physiological factors (Stress level, Blood Pressure)

## ðŸš€ Objective

To build a predictive model that can identify individuals likely to suffer from sleep disorders, aiding in early diagnosis and preventive care.
